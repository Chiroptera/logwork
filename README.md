Simple program to log tasks. During a task it captures and stores the name of the active window. The idea is to use the active window name over time as a proxy for focus on a task.

Dependencies:
 - xdotool


TODO:
 - functions to retrieve data from database
 - pomodoro integration
 - autocomplete task
 - data analysis
 - nicer user interaction (notifications, shortcuts)
 - auto unpause (by checking mouse/keyboard activity on same window as befoe)
